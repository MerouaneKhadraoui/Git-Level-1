## Solution


## Step 1 - Switch to Storage Server

In KodeKloud Engineer, you first connect to the Storage Server:

```bash
ssh natasha@ststor01
# password: Bl@kW
```

---

## Step 2 - Install Git

Update repos and install `git` using yum:

```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

---

## Step 3 - Create Bare Git Repository

A bare repository is required for central collaboration. Create it in `/opt`:

```bash
sudo git init --bare /opt/news.git
```

---

## Step 4 - Verify Repository

Check that it is indeed a bare repo:

```bash
ls -a /opt/news.git
```

You should see files like:
`HEAD`, `config`, `description`, `hooks/`, `info/`, `objects/`, `refs/`
